# Modeling Maps Using Graph Theory 
CS-2.2 Graph project proposal

## Description
- This project will tackle the common problem of maps. when we use maps we always want choose the fastest route or sometimes safest route. 
    - Vertices are the locations on the map
    - Weights are the distance between them

- This project solve the following: 
    1. Shortest Path from A to B
    1. Cheapest(fastest) Path
    1. Reachibility of the Location(most connected)
