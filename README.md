# Modeling Maps Using Graph Theory 
CS-2.2 Graph project proposal

## Description
- This project will tackle the common problem of maps. when we use maps we always want choose the fastest route or sometimes safest route. 
    - Vertices are the locations on the map.
    - Weights are the distance(in miles) between them.

- This project solve the following: 
    1. Shortest Path from A to B
    1. Minimum Spanning Tree(what is best route to travel all destination)
        - On your trip to Venice, you plan to visit all the important world heritage sites but are short on time. To make your itinerary work, you decide to use Kruskalâ€™s algorithm using disjoint sets.[example](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-example/)
    1. The busiest intersection(most connected vertex)
    1. Miles away()
    

- Details
    - It is assumed that the graph is undirected
