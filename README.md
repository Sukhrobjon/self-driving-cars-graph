# Modeling Maps Using Graph Theory 
CS-2.2 Graph project proposal

## Description


### This project solve the followings: 
1. Shortest Path from A to B(using Dijkstra's algorithm)
2. The busiest intersection(most connected vertex)
3. Find near me(find all location near by specified miles)
  
### Graph component specific to this project:
- Vertices are the locations on the map.
- Weights are the distance(in miles) between them.

### Details
- It is assumed that the graph is undirected
- Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Sukhrobjon/self-driving-cars-graph/blob/master/documentation.md)
- [Blog post]() on medium
