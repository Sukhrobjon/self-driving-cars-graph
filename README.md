# Modeling Maps Using Graph Theory 
CS-2.2 Graph project proposal

## Description
- This project will tackle the common problem of modeling maps. When we use maps we always want choose the fastest route or sometimes safest route. The entire premise of Google Maps is using a big giant graph with nodes and edges to figure out fastest or shortest way to travel. That’s all Google Maps is–a big graph with lots of nodes and edges.[resource](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2011/09/14/google-maps-its-just-one-big-graph/)

### This project solve the following: 
1. Shortest Path from A to B(using Dijkstra's algorithm)
2. The busiest intersection(most connected vertex)
3. Find near me(find all location near by specified miles)
  
### Graph component specific to this project:
- Vertices are the locations on the map.
- Weights are the distance(in miles) between them.

### Details
- It is assumed that the graph is undirected
- Documentation can be found [here]()
- [Blog post]() on medium
