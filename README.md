# Modeling Maps Using Graph Theory 
CS-2.2 Graph project proposal

## Description
- This project will tackle the common problem of maps. when we use maps we always want choose the fastest route or sometimes safest route. 
    - Vertices are the locations on the map.
    - Weights are the distance(in miles) between them.

- This project solve the following: 
    1. Shortest Path from A to B(using Dijkstra's algorithm)
    1. The busiest intersection(most connected vertex)
    1. Find near me(find all location near by specified miles)
    

- Details
    - It is assumed that the graph is undirected
