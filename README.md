# Modeling Maps Using Graph Theory 
CS-2.2 Graph project proposal

## Description
- This project will tackle the common problem of maps. when we use maps we always want choose the fastest route or sometimes safest route. 
    - Vertices are the locations on the map.
    - Weights are the distance(in miles) between them.

- This project solve the following: 
    1. Shortest Path from A to B
    1. Minimum Spanning Tree(what is best route to travel all destination)
    1. All posibble paths(routes) from A to B
    1. Cheapest(fastest) Path(Uses Dijktra's algorithm)
    

- Details
    - It is assumed that locations(vertices) are undirected
