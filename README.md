# Modeling Maps Using Graph Theory 
CS-2.2 Graph project proposal

## Description
- This project will tackle the common problem of maps. when we use maps we always want choose the fastest route or sometimes safest route. 
    - Vertices are the locations on the map.
    - Weights are the distance(in miles) between them.

- This project solve the following: 
    1. Shortest Path from A to B
    1. Minimum Spanning Tree(what is best route to travel all destination)
        - On your trip to Venice, you plan to visit all the important world heritage sites but are short on time. To make your itinerary work, you decide to use Kruskal’s algorithm using disjoint sets.[example](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-example/)
    1. All posibble paths(routes) from A to B
    1. Cheapest(fastest) Path(Uses Dijktra's algorithm)
    

- Details
    - It is assumed that locations(vertices) are undirected
